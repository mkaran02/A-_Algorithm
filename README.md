# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

## 🚀 Introduction
The **A* (A-Star) Algorithm** is one of the most efficient pathfinding algorithms used in artificial intelligence, robotics, and game development. It finds the shortest path between a start and a goal node by considering both the actual distance traveled and an estimated distance to the goal.

## 📌 Features
- Implements the A* algorithm for grid-based pathfinding.
- Uses a heuristic function (Manhattan distance) to estimate the shortest path.
- Avoids obstacles while navigating the optimal route.
- Provides a step-by-step explanation within the code for easy understanding.

## 🛠 Installation
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Clone this repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkaran02/A-_Algorithm.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd A-_Algorithm
   ```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the Python script to see the A* algorithm in action:
```bash
python app.py
```

## 📜 Algorithm Explanation
The A* algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize the start node and calculate **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**.
2. Add the start node to the open list.
3. While the open list is not empty:
   - Select the node with the lowest **f(n)**.
   - If it is the goal node, reconstruct the path and terminate.
   - Otherwise, expand the node by adding its neighbors.
   - Calculate their **g(n), h(n), and f(n)** values and add them to the open list.
   - Repeat until the goal is reached.

## 📌 Example Output
For a 5x5 grid with obstacles, the output may look like:
```bash
Shortest Path Found: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]
```
This path shows the optimal route from the start node **(0,0)** to the goal node **(4,4)** avoiding obstacles.

## 🏆 Applications
- **Navigation Systems** (e.g., Google Maps 🗺️)
- **Game AI** (e.g., NPC movement in video games 🎮)
- **Robotics** (e.g., Autonomous delivery robots 🤖)
- **Network Routing** (e.g., Finding the best path for data packets)
